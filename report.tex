% Introduction

\section{Introduction}

Introduction to your exciting topic including
some citation~\cite{Plankton2003}. Define citations
in \verb+references.bib+ that you find in
the latex source folder.

% Second Section

\section{My Fancy Second Section}

My second section is even better than the
first one\footnote{Proof omitted.}
because it contains a footnote as well as another
citation~\cite{Plankton2011}. Everything else is
explained in Figure~\ref{fig:dummy}. Always make sure
that all figures are referenced.
