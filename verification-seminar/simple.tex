\section{Introduction}
Correctness of computer systems is important in our software dependent society. We depend more and more on this modern computer systems. Such systems consist of complex hardware and software components. So correctness of both hardware and software is important. However, it is much harder to ensure the correctness of the software part of these systems. As the complexity of the software parts are getting more complex than that of the underlying hardware.  And manual inspection of complex software is error-prone and costly.  Numerous formal tools to find functional design bugs in hardware are available and in wide-spread use.  In contrast, the market for software verification tools is still in its infancy. A lot of research in this field is going on. We need highly automated method that provides rigorous guarantee of quality. These methods should be scalable enough to match the enormous complexity of software systems. Bounded model checking (BMC) of programs is one of such methods used for software verification. In this paper we will explore LLBMC, an implementation of the idea of  Bounded model checking.

\paragraph{Outline}
The remainder of this article is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{previous work} gives account of previous work.
Our new and exciting results are described in Section~\ref{results}.
Finally, Section~\ref{conclusions} gives the conclusions.

\section{Previous work}\label{previous work}
A much longer \LaTeXe{} example was written by Gil~\cite{Gil:02}.

\section{Results}\label{results}
In this section we describe the results.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}
We worked hard, and achieved very little.
